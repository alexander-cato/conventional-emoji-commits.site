How should I deal with commit messages in the initial development phase?

#content
We recommend that you proceed as if youâ€™ve already released the product. Typically somebody, even if itâ€™s your fellow software developers, is using your software. Theyâ€™ll want to know whatâ€™s fixed, what breaks etc.

Are the emojis in the commit title specific or can I choose my own?

#content
While the emojis provided in the [Conventional Emoji Commits list](/list/list) offer a guideline, you can choose your own for custom scopes. However, be aware that using custom emojis might cause automated tools to malfunction, as the data extraction of these emojis could potentially fail. It's best to be consistent across your project. If you believe a specific emoji should be added to the standard list, consider submitting a [PR](https://github.com/conventional-emoji-commits/conventional-emoji-commits.site/pulls).

Might Conventional Emoji Commits lead developers to limit the type of commits they make because theyâ€™ll be thinking in the types provided?  

#content
Conventional Emoji Commits encourages us to make more of certain types of commits such as fixes. Other than that, the flexibility of Conventional Emoji Commits allows your team to come up with their own types and change those types over time.

What do I do if I accidentally use the wrong emoji or commit type? 

#content
Prior to merging or releasing the mistake, we recommend using `git rebase -i` to edit the commit history. After release, the cleanup will be different according to what tools and processes you use.

Do all my contributors need to use the Conventional Emoji Commits specification? 

#content
No! If you use a squash based workflow on Git, lead maintainers can clean up the commit messages as theyâ€™re mergedâ€”adding no workload to casual committers. A common workflow for this is to have your git system automatically squash commits from a pull request and present a form for the lead maintainer to enter the proper git commit message for the merge.

How does Conventional Emoji Commits handle revert commits? 

#content
Reverting code can be complicated: are you reverting multiple commits? if you revert a feature, should the next release instead be a patch?  
Conventional Emoji Commits does not make an explicit effort to define revert behavior. Instead, we leave it to tooling authors to use the flexibility of types and footers to develop their logic for handling reverts.  
One recommendation is to use the `revert` type, and a footer that references the commit SHAs that are being reverted:
::callout{type="info"}  
`revert: let us never again speak of the noodle incident`  
`Refs: 676104e, a215868`
