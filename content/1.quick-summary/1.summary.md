# Summary

The Conventional Emoji Commits specification is an adaptation of the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification, adding a splash of color to your commits through emojis. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history, making it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with [SemVer](http://semver.org/), by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

The commit message should be structured as follows:

::callout{type="primary"}
\<emoji>\<type>\[optional scope]: \<description> :br
\[optional body] :br
\[optional footer(s)] :br
::

:br
#### The commit contains the following structural elements:

::list{type="info"}
- `🩹 fix`: A commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
- `✨ feat`: A commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
- `🚨 BREAKING CHANGE`: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a `❗` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
- Types other than `🩹fix`: and `✨feat`: are allowed. Examples include `🛠️build`:, `🧹 chore`:, `🤖 ci`:, `📚 docs`:, `🎨 style`:, `♻️ refactor`:, `⚡️ perf`:, `🧪 test`:. For a comprehensive list of recommended types, please refer to this [list](/list/list).
- Footers other than 🚨 BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to [git trailer format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers).
::

Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Emoji Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE).

A scope may be provided to a commit’s type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., `✨ feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.
